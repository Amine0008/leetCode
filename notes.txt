** Choose a data structure

** Study the theory: Read about the data structure you've chosen, including its definition, properties, operations, and algorithms. You can refer to textbooks, online tutorials, or other resources to help   
    you understand the theory.

** Implement the data structure: 

** Solve problems: Practice solving problems related to the data structure you've chosen. Start with simpler problems and gradually move on to more complex ones. LeetCode is a great resource for practice  
   problems, as you've mentioned.

	Analyze your solutions: Once you've solved a problem, analyze your solution to see if there's a way to improve it. Consider the time and space complexity of your solution and see if there's a     
	more efficient way to solve the problem.
